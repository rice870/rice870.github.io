                My name is Isaac and I am pretty unfamiliar with html, but I'm getting the hang of it. I've learned about it before, but that was years ago and I've forgotten all about it.
                It's a bit sad I guess, but such is life. I did the github with this thing. That's pretty epic.<br><br>
                So you may have notices I am cringe. Well have you considered you are cringe???
